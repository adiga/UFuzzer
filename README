********************************************
UFuzzer is a linux system call fuzzing tool.
********************************************

This has been tested only on Ubuntu 10.10. It needs kernel code
coverage to be turned on.

To run:
1) Kernel code coverage has to be turned on.
        Note on turning on gcov-kernel for Ubuntu source 10.10:
        Run “make menuconfig”.Navigate through “General Setup —>”,
        “GCOV-based kernel profiling —>” and select “Enable
        gcov-based kernel profiling” and “Profile entire kernel”
        options. Save and exit, then build and install the kernel.
        Also check: http://linuxtweaking.blogspot.com/2010/05/how-to-compile-kernel-on-ubuntu-1004.html

2) Modify options in src/common-header.h
3) make
4) Run ufuzzer

Caution: Running ufuzzer may damage your files. Safe to run it in a Linux
guest OS on VM.

ufuzzer crashes: Since it is still in development stage, ufuzzer may crash.
Before running it again run clean.sh to clean the files and
directories.

Output: Code coverage data is stored in code_coverage.txt
